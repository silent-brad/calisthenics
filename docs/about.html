    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate advocate for bodyweight training and functional movement. 
        This blog documents my journey through calisthenics, sharing techniques, 
        progressions, and insights I've learned along the way.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Training Guides</strong> - Step-by-step progressions for various calisthenics skills</li>
        <li><strong>Movement Analysis</strong> - Breaking down complex movements into manageable components</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <blockquote>
        "The body achieves what the mind believes. Through consistent practice and 
        progressive overload, we can unlock incredible strength using nothing but 
        our own bodyweight."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
        I believe in the power of simplicity - that the most effective training 
        comes from mastering fundamental movements and progressively challenging 
        ourselves with variations and increased difficulty.
