= Getting Started with Calisthenics

So you want to build strength using nothing but your bodyweight? Welcome to the world of calisthenics – a training method that has been around for centuries and continues to be one of the most effective ways to build functional strength, mobility, and control.

== Why Choose Calisthenics?

*Accessibility*: No gym membership required. Your body is your gym, and you can train anywhere – at home, in a park, or while traveling.

*Progressive*: Every exercise can be scaled to your current level and progressively made more challenging as you get stronger.

*Functional*: The movements translate directly to real-world activities and sports performance.

*Cost-effective*: Minimal equipment needed. A pull-up bar and some floor space will take you very far.

== The Big Six

Paul Wade, in his book "Convict Conditioning," identifies six fundamental movement patterns that form the foundation of calisthenics training:

1. *Push-ups* (horizontal pushing)
2. *Squats* (leg strength)  
3. *Pull-ups* (vertical pulling)
4. *Leg raises* (anterior chain/core)
5. *Bridges* (posterior chain)
6. *Handstand push-ups* (vertical pushing)

== Starting Your Journey

=== Week 1-2: Assessment
- Perform maximum reps of basic push-ups, squats, and pull-ups
- Hold a plank for maximum time
- Test your flexibility with basic stretches

=== Week 3-4: Foundation Building
- Focus on perfect form over high reps
- Start with easier progressions if needed (knee push-ups, assisted squats)
- Establish a consistent routine (3-4 times per week)

=== Month 2 and beyond: Progressive Overload
- Gradually increase difficulty through:
  - More repetitions
  - Harder progressions
  - Slower tempo
  - Added holds/pauses

== Common Mistakes to Avoid

*Rushing progressions*: Master each level before moving to the next. Your joints and connective tissue need time to adapt.

*Neglecting the posterior chain*: Don't just focus on the "show muscles." Bridges and rows are just as important as push-ups and pull-ups.

*Ignoring mobility work*: Spend 10-15 minutes on stretching and mobility work after each session.

== Sample Beginner Routine

Perform 3 times per week with at least one rest day between sessions:

- *Push-ups*: 3 sets of 5-15 reps
- *Squats*: 3 sets of 10-20 reps  
- *Rows or Pull-ups*: 3 sets of 3-8 reps
- *Plank*: 3 holds of 20-60 seconds
- *Glute bridges*: 3 sets of 10-15 reps

== The Path Ahead

Remember, calisthenics is a journey, not a destination. The skills you'll eventually master – muscle-ups, handstand push-ups, pistol squats, human flags – all build upon the fundamentals you're learning today.

Be patient with yourself, stay consistent, and enjoy the process. Your future strong self will thank you for starting today.
