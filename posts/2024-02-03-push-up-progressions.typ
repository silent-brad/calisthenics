= Mastering Push-Up Progressions

The humble push-up is often the first exercise people learn, yet it's frequently performed incorrectly and underestimated in its potential for building serious strength. Today we'll explore how to progress from your first push-up all the way to advanced variations that will challenge even seasoned athletes.

== Perfect Push-Up Form

Before diving into progressions, let's establish what a perfect push-up looks like:

*Starting Position*:
- Hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width
- Fingers spread for stability
- Body in straight line from head to heels
- Core engaged, glutes tight

*The Movement*:
- Lower body as one unit until chest nearly touches ground
- Push up explosively while maintaining body alignment
- Full range of motion on every rep

*Breathing*:
- Inhale on the way down
- Exhale forcefully on the way up

== The Progressive Path

=== Beginner Level (Weeks 1-8)

*Wall Push-ups (Step 1)*
- Stand arm's length from wall
- Place palms flat against wall at shoulder height
- Perform push-up motion against wall
- Goal: 3 sets of 50 reps

*Incline Push-ups (Step 2)*
- Use stairs, bench, or sturdy elevated surface
- Higher the surface = easier the exercise
- Gradually work toward lower surfaces
- Goal: 3 sets of 40 reps on knee-high surface

*Knee Push-ups (Step 3)*
- Drop to knees, maintain straight line from knees to head
- Full range of motion, chest to floor
- Don't let hips sag or pike up
- Goal: 3 sets of 30 reps

=== Intermediate Level (Months 2-6)

*Half Push-ups (Step 4)*
- Full push-up position (plank)
- Lower only halfway down
- Build strength in the bottom range
- Goal: 2 sets of 25 reps

*Full Push-ups (Step 5)*
- The classic push-up with perfect form
- Chest touches floor on every rep
- Control the descent (2-3 seconds)
- Goal: 2 sets of 20 reps

*Close Push-ups (Step 6)*
- Hands closer together (diamond shape optional)
- Targets triceps more heavily
- Requires more core stability  
- Goal: 2 sets of 15 reps

=== Advanced Level (6+ Months)

*Uneven Push-ups (Step 7)*
- One hand on elevated surface (basketball, book)
- Develops unilateral strength
- Alternate hands between sets
- Goal: 2 sets of 12 reps each side

*Half One-Arm Push-ups (Step 8)*
- One hand on ground, other behind back
- Lower only halfway down
- Use wide stance for stability
- Goal: 1 set of 10 reps each arm

*Lever Push-ups (Step 9)*
- One arm does the work, other just touches ground
- Non-working arm provides minimal assistance
- Goal: 1 set of 8 reps each arm

*One-Arm Push-ups (Step 10)*
- The ultimate pushing exercise
- One hand behind back, full range of motion
- Requires exceptional strength and stability
- Goal: 1 set of 5 reps each arm

== Programming Your Push-Up Training

*Frequency*: 3-4 times per week with rest days between
*Sets and Reps*: Focus on quality over quantity
*Progression*: Master each step before advancing
*Patience*: Expect 6-8 weeks minimum per progression level

=== Sample Training Week

*Monday*: Current progression level
*Tuesday*: Previous progression (higher reps for volume)
*Wednesday*: Rest or light stretching
*Thursday*: Current progression level  
*Friday*: Advanced progression attempt (even if just negative/lowering portion)
*Weekend*: Rest

== Common Issues and Solutions

*Sagging hips*: Engage core harder, practice planks
*Limited range of motion*: Work on shoulder and chest mobility
*Wrist pain*: Use push-up handles or fists instead of palms
*Plateauing*: Add pauses, change tempo, or incorporate other variations

== Advanced Variations to Explore

Once you've mastered the basic progression, these variations add new challenges:

- *Archer Push-ups*: One arm straight, one bent
- *Hindu Push-ups*: Dynamic movement with hip mobility
- *Handstand Push-ups*: Ultimate vertical pushing exercise
- *Pseudo Planche Push-ups*: Hands positioned lower, lean forward

== The Mental Game

Push-up progressions teach us patience and persistence. The jump from knee push-ups to full push-ups can take months. The leap from full push-ups to one-arm push-ups might take years.

This isn't failure â€“ it's the path. Every rep you perform is an investment in your future strength. Trust the process, and remember that consistency trumps intensity every time.
