        progressions, and insights I've learned along the way.

    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <blockquote>
        "The body achieves what the mind believes. Through consistent practice and 
        progressive overload, we can unlock incredible strength using nothing but 
        our own bodyweight."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
        I believe in the power of simplicity - that the most effective training 
        comes from mastering fundamental movements and progressively challenging 
        ourselves with variations and increased difficulty.
